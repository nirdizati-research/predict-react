When uploading a single log file the user must specify how the training and test set are generated. This is configured in the splitting phase. Uploading two log files allows the user to fine-tune the contents of the training and test set. When uploading two log files the user can proceed to the Labelling or Training pages without creating the split.',

Due to the amount of configuration options, the application provides a page to try out different configurations for labelling types, prefix lengths and log padding types. This allows the user to see the distribution of labels in an encoded log file before applying data mining methods. For example, using the "no padding" option will mean that a high prefix length will decrease the amount of total traces in the training sets, leading to different label counts.',
